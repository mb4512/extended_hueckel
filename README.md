## Extended Hückel model in a Jupyter notebook

This Jupyter notebook implements the "Extended Hückel method", a most basic electronic structure solver for organic 
molecules. The method is describe in lecture 2. The code includes some common features of contemporary electronic 
structure code, such as local atomic basis sets, overlap integrals, as well as solving for and visualising eigenstates.


## Lecture notes

These are slides of a 4-lecture series I held on the 1st and 2nd of May, 2025, on "Atomistic Modelling of Materials" in 
the Department of Engineering Science at the Unversity of Oxford. The intention of these lectures was to provide an accessible 
introduction to quantum mechanics and atomistic modelling specifically aimed at post-graduate engineers. Some knowledge of 
differential calculus and linear algebra is assumed.

The content is as follows:

**Lecture 1: Quantum Mechanics in 1 hour**  
We form an intuitive understanding of quantum mechanics, starting with the 
particle in a well and finishing with the hydrogen atom

**Lecture 2: Applied Quantum Mechanics**  
We learn how to design an approximate QM solver in Python and apply it to small molecules, 
and learn about the state-of-the-art solver used in computational materials science (density functional theory)

**Lecture 3: Materials properties from atoms**  
We learn how fundamental properties of materials, such as the elasticity tensor, 
can be obtained from atomistic methods, and go through some common simulation techniques

**Lecture 4: Collective phenomena: from plasticity to radiation damage**  
Using recent research in our group as an example, we show how atomistic simulation methods 
can be used to formulate insight to materials properties from first principles
